# Task Tracker Application

This project implements the frontend of my task's tracker system. The web-based frontend communicates
with the [Task Tracker Backend](https://github.com/tomwey2/task-tracker-backend-rest-spring-mongodb) via
REST api.

## Usage

This command runs the application in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Run the application tests:
